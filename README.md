This project implements a real-time multiplayer chess game using Node.js with the Express.js web framework for the server-side, and vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend. Socket.IO is utilized for real-time game state synchronization and messaging. Additionally, JavaScript classes were created to manage the game board, pieces, and users.
